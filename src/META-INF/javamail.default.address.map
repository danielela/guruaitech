# javamail.default.address.map
# This file maps default address types to the corresponding "real"
# address types.  The "real" address types are the ones that the
# mail.imap.fetchsize and mail.pop3.fetchsize property settings
# refer to.  For example, the "real" address type for "rfc822" might
# be "mime".  Or the "real" address type for "rfc2369" might be
# "mime".  Or it might be "rfc822".  It all depends on what the
# server supports.  You can find out what address types are supported
# by a server by enabling session debugging and watching what it
# advertises.  The format of this file is key=value, one per line.
rfc822=mime
